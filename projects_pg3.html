            <summary>RGB0</summary>
            <h1>RGB0 is the most influential project I've ever undertaken.</h1>
            <p>It started out as a game I was inspired to make for fun, but turned into a competition-enterer for my school.</p>
            <p>It's a platformer but I was concious of how games are supposed to make people feel. I knew how to program well and draw up good concepts for games.</p>
            <p>It features a jetpack and a large focus on a bullet-hell aspect of play.</p>
            <p>RGB0 takes a huge amount of inspiration from my older projects, even going as far as to take direct characters. It features a prison setup (PNB) and the icon boss is Deromn (Phase Trial).</p>
            <p>I love this project because it consumed my life and I really enjoyed it. If you knew me, you knew about that game. I learned a lot while making it and I have a lot to show for it.</p>
            <p>Since it's so recent, there's a lot of documented history. Here's a <a href="">playlist on YouTube</a> that shows some devlogs.</p>
            <p>Play the newest versions of the game <a href="">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I will be making a full documentary of this game very soon. Stay tuned for that!</p>

            <summary>Enterprise Account Generator</summary>
            <h1>This was the first time I tried to dip my feet into other programming languages.</h1>
            <p>I made it in python and it generates emails and passwords for any list of people.</p>

            <summary>Celly mk-IV</summary>
            <h1>Celly mk-IV is a discord bot that I made using Python.</h1>
            <p>The history behind the identity of the bot is that my dog's name is Celly. I made two bots (MK-II and MK-3) to be named after her. Neither were made with any programming language.</p>
            <p>The reason that the icon is a hue-shifted Terminator is because I made the robot become progressively more evil-looking over the course of its marks. Celly, my dog, is adorable and fluffy. MK-II is very strange and unnverving. MK-3 is strange and unnerving in the sense that looking at a skinless human is unnerving. The Terminator is just outright awesome/badaxe to look at. </p>
            <p>Celly mk-IV runs off of my Raspberry Pi 4. It can only be invited to servers by me.</p>
            <p>It has lots of features. You can use 'hc' or 'hey celly' to start a command. You can then say 'rickroll' or 'don't' rickroll, and neither will rickroll you. If you say 'fart' in any way shape or form, the bot will subtract from the Puffhyu score. My friend's online alias is Puffhyu and I made a score based on how much people like him or not. You can say 'I love puffhyu' or 'I hate puffhyu' to raise or decrease the score by one, and that is registered into a text file that is saved locally.</p>
            <p>If you ping it, it'll just tell you how to ask for commands. If you ping me/my account, it will say 'Tarin probably doesn't want to talk to you'. I thought that would be funny. My friend's bot says 'I will beat you to death' so mine says 'I promise not to beat you to death'. Unfortunately, I stopped adding to it because I felt like it wasn't really going anywhere, and I'm happy with how it turned out.</p>

            <h1>I feel like this is famililar for some reason.</h1>
            <p>I don't really know what inspired me to make this. I wanted to try out making a website so I made something which I will not be sharing, and then I wanted a project to be able to put what I learned into something that I could benefit from.</p>
            <p>I really have liked the idea of a portfolio that I made from the ground up, and I've always wanted a place where I can store</p>
            <p>Link is <a href="file:///C:/Users/tarin/.vscode/html/Portfolio/ThePorT4lio/projects_pg3.html">here</a>. :)</p>

            <summary>Ant Exterminator</summary>
            <h1>This is a cursor-aim training game that I began developing.</h1>
            <p>The reason that it is in honorable mentions is because I never really finished it. In fact, I barely got close. There were supposed to be different gamemodes and leaderboards and all of these big features. I just never got around to making it a reality.</p>
            <p>There is no real build or anything, so it's not worth the trouble of putting up. Here's a gif of all of the gameplay</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I had very little prior experience with C#, and it was under a time crunch.</p>
            <p>I wanted to do it for a school project but I underestimated how difficult C# would be to learn compared to other languages.</p>

            <summary>PNB: Third Bird</summary>
            <h1>Ah, Paint: Not Blood...</h1>
            <p>My first game and my first cs project.</p>
            <p>This is where my journey began. It was made in GameMaker: Studio 2 and I followed Shaun Spalding's youtube tutorial series to make it.</p>
            <p>I didn't follow them all the way through. In fact, I only went a few episodes in before I took it into my own hands.</p>
            <p>It is a truly terrible game but I love it to death because of its sentimental value to me.</p>
            <p>This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6G5jP0ZYOc">video of the most recently worked on build</a> (2018). Unfortunately, it was lost to time. That is very fortunate for our sensory functions, though.</p>
            <p>Everything about the video is horrible and that's awesome.</p>
            <p>I like it because it shows how much I've grown. Not just with programming, spritework, or even gamedev in general. Even as a person and how my taste in things has changed since the 6th grade.</p>
            <p>You can play and see the really old builds and stuff <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/3rdBrdPNB/370914">here.</a></p>
            <p>One last thing, the title of it actually comes from a project I did in fifth grade. I called it that because of school policies that were set in place for gore. Clever. Very clever.</p>

            <summary>Overgrowth</summary>
            <h1>Overgrowth is a game I made in 7th grade (2019).</h1>
            <p>It was never taken past prototype but I think it's important to put it on here, because it's one of the first things I think of when I think of my historic games.</p>
            <p>It is a plant-themed tower defense game where, for every enemy that you kill, you gain points. You could then either invest this into towers or you could level up the game.</p>
            <p>Leveling up the game, depending on what level, can unlock towers as well as new enemies. For example, you unlock Buckets on level 5, which are indestructible to leaves, but can be killed by spores, which are unlocked on level 6.</p>
            <p>Personally, I think it's okay in execution, but it's regrettable that I wasn't skilled enough and didn't have enoug motivation to let it come into its fullest fruition.</p>
            <h1>Video and playable link are coming soon.</h1>

            <summary>Phase Trial</summary>
            <h1>When I think of this game, I think of it as the successor to PNB.</h1>
            <p>It is another platformer with many similarities the rest of the ones that I made.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of undescribable story, both laden within the game and in the making of it.</p>
            <p>For example, the main character of the game is a green square named Tungsten. He is named this, but it never shows up in the actual game. Even though the only remnants of the game don't feature the other levels that I created, there is a lot of content that influences my game-making work to this day. I name every player layer 'Tung' and any time I add a story mode to games, it always has a sewer level (there is no way for me to recover it, sadly). Another example of this phenomenom is the character Deromn and what is associated with him. In Phase Trial, he represents how I used to talk at the time which I made him. Now, there is a boss in RGB0 which uses his face and name but talks differently. However, it uses the same soundtrack.</p>
            <p>The sewer level featured slugs which came in all different sizes. It was meant to be gross, as the color scheme was brownish-yellow in nature.</p>

            <summary>Forbidden Milk</summary>
            <h1>Forbidden Milk is a game that I made with friends.</h1>
            <p>I did all of the programming and they did all of the other stuff.</p>
            <p>My friend group and I had liked the idea of making a game together. Since I had a lot of experience, I felt that I could help them get started in their adventure. Unfortunately, we stopped after a few weeks of development. This was for a number of reasons. I stopped programming because my friends lost interest and my friends lost interest because I was doing most of the work. That's how I interpreted it, anyway, I'm sure they each have their own set of thoughts.</p>
            <p>One thing that I did differently in RGB0 is that I didn't focus a lot on sharing it. I focused on the hard work first. That allowed me to not feel burnt out after my months of working on it.</p>
            <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Fi77Pd-Uk&list=PLVOpWXRglOpfAJp3TWbXVBQVcIhYRs4SI&index=1">YouTube Series</a>, where you can watch devlogs/progress of it.</p>

            <p>I made this in 6th grade (2019) because I was very much enjoying making PNB: Third Bird and I wanted to make an assignment I had easy and fun for me.</p>
            <p>Watch a video of it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T10VH1Aa-yg">here</a>, the playable version has been unfortunately lost to time.</p>

            <summary>Bubba Tech Utilities</summary>
            <h1>This is a utility application that I made in C# with my dad.</h1>
            <p>Its primary focus was to have buttons to open zoom links for online learning, as it was tedious to have them bookmarked. Plus, I could customize it much better.</p>
            <p>It also did other things such as have games that you can open.</p>
            <p>It was a fun project, but I stopped using it after the school year ended. It was also tedious to have to input every new game I was interested in.</p>
            <p>I was going to make it easy to change the links without having to go into the source code for profit, but I never got around to it. Maybe I will upload this to github eventually, but there's not a lot to see.</p>
