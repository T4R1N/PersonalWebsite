        <h2>Kickstart - 4/3/24</h2>
        <h1>#3.0 >> 11:10a</h1>
        <p>It has been awhile since I have touched this. Recently, I have been doing many fun projects that I would like to share.</p>
        <p>My birthday is coming up. I will be 17, and I'm managing Varsity (hopefully) tennis, loads of schoolwork, college prep work, work at a major tech corp (Best Buy), my own project, and my own hobbies.</p>
        <p>As I write this now, in fact, I should be doing some of the aforementioned assignments. However, I am more inspired by and hopeful toward these fun projects and avenues of mine. I think they give me meaning.</p>
        <p>As I get back into this, I will add the projects I've been doing, start blogging about fun things I'm doing (tech, programming, art, reading, gamedev, worldbuilding, writing, stationery, etc.), and revamp this site. All of this in addition to everything else. :-)</p>
        <h1>#3.1 >> 11:19a</h1>
        <p>I always carry a notebook on me. I have a planner with a calendar. I have three calendars at home. I have a notebook for both school and for my game. I also have online task managers for them. I like things to be organized, and I want my project portfolio and blog to display my creations in a similar manner.</p>
        <p>I will add a to-do tab. That seems the most intuitive to me for getting things done. To-do: add a to-do list; add a rework of all current projects on here; add all of the projects I've been working on; add a daily journal tab; add time & date to everything</p>

        <h2>Potential For Me - 5/22/22</h2>
        <h1>#2.0</h1>
        <p>My friend recently recommended me a new game that I've been enjoying.</p>
        <p>It is called <b>Hearts of Iron 4</b> and it is a real-time war strategy game.</p>
        <p>Something that caught my eye was the fact that there were mods. I haven't done any research, but I think that it could be a fun project to undertake.</p>
        <p>If I was to do that, I would want to make it so that you could have your own country which you could conquer the world with.</p>

        <h2>First Blog Entry! - 5/21/22</h2>
        <h1>#1.0</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the first ever entry on the PorT4lio.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share some things about it with you so that they will not be lost to time.</p>
        <p>First thing's first, I've been working on my portfolio for a few days now. I thought it would be a fun project to have one place for myself to look at and add projects that I've made over the course of my life. I knew that it would teach me about the nitty-gritty of websites and the internet itself, as well as look good for job employers in the far future.</p>
        <p>As of right now, I have to finish the entries for all of the projects I've made, as well as maybe add a category for unfinished/insignificant projects. That will be for a later time, though.</p>
        <p>I'm planning on using my Raspberry Pi to host as the server and invest some money into buying the domain <i>tarinphippen.com</i>. I want to know how to effectively run a web server and port that into a domain.</p>
