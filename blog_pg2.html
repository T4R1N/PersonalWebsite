        <h1>First Blog Entry! 5/21/22</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to the first ever entry on the PorT4lio.</p>
        <p>I wanted to share some things about it with you so that they will not be lost to time.</p>
        <p>First thing's first, I've been working on my portfolio for a few days now. I thought it would be a fun project to have one place for myself to look at and add projects that I've made over the course of my life. I knew that it would teach me about the nitty-gritty of websites and the internet itself, as well as look good for job employers in the far future.</p>
        <p>As of right now, I have to finish the entries for all of the projects I've made, as well as maybe add a category for unfinished/insignificant projects. That will be for a later time, though.</p>
        <p>I'm planning on using my Raspberry Pi to host as the server and invest some money into buying the domain <i>tarinphippen.com</i>. I want to know how to effectively run a web server and port that into a domain.</p>
