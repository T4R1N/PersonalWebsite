        <h1>Welcome, my name is Tarin.</h1>
        <p>I am currently about to end my freshman year of high school.</p>
        <p>I am 15 years old and I like to do lots of computer-science projects. I am completely self-taught but I will be taking an AP Computer Science class for my Sophomore year.</p>
        <p>Here are some topics I'm interested in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>GMS2 Language/Developing Games</li>
            <li>Making apps and tools with Python</li>
            <li>Operating systems </li>
            <li>Making websites with HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Editing and publishing videos</li>
            <li>Unity/C#</li>
            <li>Graphic Design</li> <!--atta boy-->
        </ul>
        <p>and I'm beginning to learn about modding Minecraft with Java.</p>
        <p>Some other topics I like include athletics, video games, working out, deconstructing grammar in languages, and social activities. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite classes are German, Biology, Math, and Social Studies. (Gym doesn't count). I don't care very much for English because it isn't the mechanics of the language, it's more how it is used, which I find boring. 
        </p>    
        <p>
            I am also an avid plant-life enjoyer and have many of them in my work spaces.
